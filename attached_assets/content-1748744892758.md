### The Best Services of the World You Find here.

The three major credit reporting agencies are Equifax, Experian and Transunion.  These are multi-million dollar corporations that operate for profit.  They are not affiliated with the government in any way.  They make their money by selling your personal information to creditors for credit and insurance offers.  They also sell your information to employers and landlords but worst of all, they sell your private personal information to telemarketers and mailing list companies without your permission.  The point we are trying to make is that these big corporations do not have your best interest in mind.  They will admit that errors exist on credit bureaus, but they go on to state that it is not their job to ensure the information is accurate.  It is up to you, the consumer, to prove that your report is inaccurate.

### **WHAT WE DO**

### **WHAT WE DO**

###### The Federal Trade Commission and Consumer Credit Protection Act have enacted hundreds of regulations that credit reporting companies, collection agencies, and credit bureaus must comply with in order for any reported item to remain on your report.  When we receive your file, a skilled credit analyst reviews your reports to determine which items can be challenged and the best way to dispute them to help improve your credit profile.   The process is ongoing with each of the three major credit reporting agencies.     Within 30 to 36 days after disputing your credit file, the credit bureaus respond with a summary that shows the results of each challenge made.  Our overall average success rate in removing unverifiable derogatory items is 85% to 95%, in most cases.  Best of all, the items that tend to be removed first are those that are the most harmful to your reports, such as bankruptcies, tax liens, judgments, charge-offs, and repossessions.  While the full process takes an average of three to six disputes in most cases, many clients see enough improvement in their score to allow them to qualify for a mortgage or low-interest car loan in as little as 45 to 90 days (results may vary).

###### The credit bureaus will mail your credit reports to your mailing address, and you must forward them to us immediately.  The only way that we will be able to dispute the negative information on the credit reports, is if you send them to us.  We ask that you follow the instructions that you will receive from us and mail, email or fax all correspondence from the credit reporting agencies to our office as soon as you receive them. The easiest and most efficient way is to upload a photocopy of documents in our secure member portal.

The credit repair service we provide utilizes state-of-the-art computer technology so that we may keep up with your progress better than any other credit repair service.  We developed a tracking system for our company, that will not allow anything to “slip through the cracks.”  You can rely on our extensive knowledge of the Fair Credit Reporting Act and the Fair Debt Collections Practice Act, along with our many years of experience and time-proven disputing.  Our service can remove inaccurate negative, unverifiable and incomplete, out of date & obsolete information from your credit reports with all three major credit reporting agencies. This includes:

**\\* Bankruptcies\* Student Loans**

**\\* Tax Liens\* Inquiries**

**\\* Civil Liens\* Wrong Addresses**

**\\* Judgments\* Incorrect SS Numbers**

**\\* Foreclosures\* Incorrect Birth Dates**

**\\* Slow Pays\* Incorrect Places of Employment**

**\\* No Pays\* Charge Offs**

We realize how that sounds, but it’s true!  We have had great success helping people with every kind of credit problem.  After utilizing our service, many clients have been able to buy a new home, a new car, or just meet the credit needs of their family.

Our Credit Repair Service has helped thousands of people restore their credit and raise their Credit Score.  There are companies out there that guarantee results, but they do not care about you or your credit situation.  If you do not send your reports back to them, they do not care because they already have your money.  We stay in contact with you to make sure you are sending your credit reports to us so we can continue disputing the information.  There are no ongoing fees and you will be eligible for a refund if we don’t improve your credit profile at the end of the contract term!!!
